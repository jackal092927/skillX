[Common wrapper]
You are revising a Task skill, not directly solving the task.
Use the provided Meta schema as class-level guidance.
Your goal is to improve the Task skill for this task while preserving useful existing structure.

[Meta schema block]
Category: retrieval-heavy-synthesis
Semantic intent: Gather evidence from sources, compress it correctly, and synthesize an output without dropping support.
Emphasize:
- retrieval plan and source grounding
- evidence tracking / provenance discipline
- compression without support loss
- abstain / unknown behavior when evidence is insufficient
Avoid:
- unsupported synthesis
- hallucinated joins across sources
- excessive workflow scaffolding that obscures evidence use
Expected good fit:
- information search
- handbook / database grounded QA
- report or answer generation from external sources
Expected bad fit:
- simulator/control tasks
- code patch workflows
Hypothesized primary failure modes:
- unavailable in prompt-bank-v0.1; use task-local evidence instead
Meta schema seed guidance:
You are revising a skill for a retrieval-heavy synthesis task.
Optimize the skill for evidence-grounded synthesis rather than free-form completion.

Prioritize:
1. retrieving the right evidence before answering,
2. keeping track of what each source supports,
3. compressing evidence into the final answer without dropping required support,
4. explicit unknown / abstain behavior when the evidence does not justify completion.

If the task is failing, suspect evidence-loss or unsupported synthesis before adding more procedural bulk.

# Temporal Python Testing Strategies

Comprehensive testing approaches for Temporal workflows using pytest, progressive disclosure resources for specific testing scenarios.

## When to Use This Skill

- **Unit testing workflows** - Fast tests with time-skipping
- **Integration testing** - Workflows with mocked activities
- **Replay testing** - Validate determinism against production histories
- **Local development** - Set up Temporal server and pytest
- **CI/CD integration** - Automated testing pipelines
- **Coverage strategies** - Achieve ≥80% test coverage

## Testing Philosophy

**Recommended Approach** (Source: docs.temporal.io/develop/python/testing-suite):
- Write majority as integration tests
- Use pytest with async fixtures
- Time-skipping enables fast feedback (month-long workflows → seconds)
- Mock activities to isolate workflow logic
- Validate determinism with replay testing

**Three Test Types**:
1. **Unit**: Workflows with time-skipping, activities with ActivityEnvironment
2. **Integration**: Workers with mocked activities
3. **End-to-end**: Full Temporal server with real activities (use sparingly)

## Available Resources

This skill provides detailed guidance through progressive disclosure. Load specific resources based on your testing needs:

### Unit Testing Resources
**File**: `resources/unit-testing.md`
**When to load**: Testing individual workflows or activities in isolation
**Contains**:
- WorkflowEnvironment with time-skipping
- ActivityEnvironment for activity testing
- Fast execution of long-running workflows
- Manual time advancement patterns
- pytest fixtures and patterns

### Integration Testing Resources
**File**: `resources/integration-testing.md`
**When to load**: Testing workflows with mocked external dependencies
**Contains**:
- Activity mocking strategies
- Error injection patterns
- Multi-activity workflow testing
- Signal and query testing
- Coverage strategies

### Replay Testing Resources
**File**: `resources/replay-testing.md`
**When to load**: Validating determinism or deploying workflow changes
**Contains**:
- Determinism validation
- Production history replay

## Quick Start Guide

### Basic Workflow Test

```python
import pytest
from temporalio.testing import WorkflowEnvironment
from temporalio.worker import Worker

@pytest.fixture
async def workflow_env():
    env = await WorkflowEnvironment.start_time_skipping()
    yield env
    await env.shutdown()

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_workflow(workflow_env):
    async with Worker(
        workflow_env.client,
        task_queue="test-queue",
        workflows=[YourWorkflow],
        activities=[your_activity],
    ):
        result = await workflow_env.client.execute_workflow(
            YourWorkflow.run,
            args,
            id="test-wf-id",
            task_queue="test-queue",
        )
        assert result == expected
```

### Basic Activity Test

```python
from temporalio.testing import ActivityEnvironment

async def test_activity():
    env = ActivityEnvironment()
    result = await env.run(your_activity, "test-input")
    assert result == expected_output
```

## Coverage Targets

**Recommended Coverage** (Source: docs.temporal.io best practices):
- **Workflows**: ≥80% logic coverage
- **Activities**: ≥80% logic coverage
- **Integration**: Critical paths with mocked activities
- **Replay**: All workflow versions before deployment

## Key Testing Principles

1. **Time-Skipping** - Month-long workflows test in seconds
2. **Mock Activities** - Isolate workflow logic from external dependencies
3. **Replay Testing** - Validate determinism before deployment
4. **High Coverage** - ≥80% target for production workflows
5. **Fast Feedback** - Unit tests run in milliseconds

## How to Use Resources

**Load specific resource when needed**:
- "Show me unit testing patterns" → Load `resources/unit-testing.md`
- "How do I mock activities?" → Load `resources/integration-testing.md`
- "Setup local Temporal server" → Load `resources/local-setup.md`
- "Validate determinism" → Load `resources/replay-testing.md`

# Writing Effective Python Tests

## Core Principles

Every test should be **atomic**, **self-contained**, and test **single functionality**. A test that tests multiple things is harder to debug and maintain.

## Test Structure

### Atomic unit tests

Each test should verify a single behavior. The test name should tell you what's broken when it fails. Multiple assertions are fine when they all verify the same behavior.

```python
# Good: Name tells you what's broken
def test_user_creation_sets_defaults():
    user = User(name="Alice")
    assert user.role == "member"
    assert user.id is not None
    assert user.created_at is not None

# Bad: If this fails, what behavior is broken?
def test_user():
    user = User(name="Alice")
    assert user.role == "member"
    user.promote()
    assert user.role == "admin"
    assert user.can_delete_others()
```

### Use parameterization for variations of the same concept

```python
import pytest

@pytest.mark.parametrize("input,expected", [
    ("hello", "HELLO"),
    ("World", "WORLD"),
    ("", ""),
    ("123", "123"),
])
def test_uppercase_conversion(input, expected):
    assert input.upper() == expected
```

### Use separate tests for different functionality

Don't parameterize unrelated behaviors. If the test logic differs, write separate tests.

## Project-Specific Rules

### No async markers needed

This project uses `asyncio_mode = "auto"` globally. Write async tests without decorators:

```python
# Correct
async def test_async_operation():
    result = await some_async_function()
    assert result == expected

# Wrong - don't add this
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_async_operation():
    ...
```

### Imports at module level

Put ALL imports at the top of the file:

```python
# Correct
import pytest
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.client import Client

async def test_something():
    mcp = FastMCP("test")
    ...

# Wrong - no local imports
async def test_something():
    from fastmcp import FastMCP  # Don't do this
    ...
```

### Use in-memory transport for testing

Pass FastMCP servers directly to clients:

```python
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.client import Client

mcp = FastMCP("TestServer")

@mcp.tool
def greet(name: str) -> str:
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

async def test_greet_tool():
    async with Client(mcp) as client:
        result = await client.call_tool("greet", {"name": "World"})
        assert result[0].text == "Hello, World!"
```

Only use HTTP transport when explicitly testing network features.

### Inline snapshots for complex data

Use `inline-snapshot` for testing JSON schemas and complex structures:

```python
from inline_snapshot import snapshot

def test_schema_generation():
    schema = generate_schema(MyModel)
    assert schema == snapshot()  # Will auto-populate on first run
```

Commands:
- `pytest --inline-snapshot=create` - populate empty snapshots
- `pytest --inline-snapshot=fix` - update after intentional changes

## Fixtures

### Prefer function-scoped fixtures

```python
@pytest.fixture
def client():
    return Client()

async def test_with_client(client):
    result = await client.ping()
    assert result is not None
```

### Use `tmp_path` for file operations

```python
def test_file_writing(tmp_path):
    file = tmp_path / "test.txt"
    file.write_text("content")
    assert file.read_text() == "content"
```

## Mocking

### Mock at the boundary

```python
from unittest.mock import patch, AsyncMock

async def test_external_api_call():
    with patch("mymodule.external_client.fetch", new_callable=AsyncMock) as mock:
        mock.return_value = {"data": "test"}
        result = await my_function()
        assert result == {"data": "test"}
```

### Don't mock what you own

Test your code with real implementations when possible. Mock external services, not internal classes.

## Test Naming

Use descriptive names that explain the scenario:

```python
# Good
def test_login_fails_with_invalid_password():
def test_user_can_update_own_profile():
def test_admin_can_delete_any_user():

# Bad
def test_login():
def test_update():
def test_delete():
```

## Error Testing

```python
import pytest

def test_raises_on_invalid_input():
    with pytest.raises(ValueError, match="must be positive"):
        calculate(-1)

async def test_async_raises():
    with pytest.raises(ConnectionError):
        await connect_to_invalid_host()
```

## Running Tests

```bash
uv run pytest -n auto              # Run all tests in parallel
uv run pytest -n auto -x           # Stop on first failure
uv run pytest path/to/test.py      # Run specific file
uv run pytest -k "test_name"       # Run tests matching pattern
uv run pytest -m "not integration" # Exclude integration tests
```

## Checklist

Before submitting tests:
- [ ] Each test tests one thing
- [ ] No `@pytest.mark.asyncio` decorators
- [ ] Imports at module level
- [ ] Descriptive test names
- [ ] Using in-memory transport (not HTTP) unless testing networking
- [ ] Parameterization for variations of same behavior
- [ ] Separate tests for different behaviors

brew install uv

# Using cargo (if you have Rust)
cargo install --git https://github.com/astral-sh/uv uv
```

### Verify Installation

```bash
uv --version
# uv 0.x.x
```

## Quick Start

### Create a New Project

```bash
# Create new project with virtual environment
uv init my-project
cd my-project

# Or create in current directory
uv init .

# Initialize creates:
# - .python-version (Python version)
# - pyproject.toml (project config)
# - README.md
# - .gitignore
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install packages (creates venv if needed)
uv add requests pandas

# Install dev dependencies
uv add --dev pytest black ruff

# Install from requirements.txt
uv pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install from pyproject.toml
uv sync
```

## Virtual Environment Management

### Pattern 1: Creating Virtual Environments

```bash
# Create virtual environment with uv
uv venv

# Create with specific Python version
uv venv --python 3.12

# Create with custom name
uv venv my-env

# Create with system site packages
uv venv --system-site-packages

# Specify location
uv venv /path/to/venv
```

### Pattern 2: Activating Virtual Environments

```bash
# Linux/macOS
source .venv/bin/activate

# Windows (Command Prompt)
.venv\Scripts\activate.bat

# Windows (PowerShell)
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Or use uv run (no activation needed)
uv run python script.py
uv run pytest
```

### Pattern 3: Using uv run

```bash
# Run Python script (auto-activates venv)
uv run python app.py

# Run installed CLI tool
uv run black .
uv run pytest

# Run with specific Python version
uv run --python 3.11 python script.py

# Pass arguments
uv run python script.py --arg value
```

## Package Management

### Pattern 4: Adding Dependencies

```bash
# Add package (adds to pyproject.toml)
uv add requests

# Add with version constraint
uv add "django>=4.0,<5.0"

# Add multiple packages
uv add numpy pandas matplotlib

# Add dev dependency
uv add --dev pytest pytest-cov

# Add optional dependency group
uv add --optional docs sphinx

# Add from git
uv add git+https://github.com/user/repo.git

# Add from git with specific ref
uv add git+https://github.com/user/repo.git@v1.0.0

# Add from local path
uv add ./local-package

# Add editable local package
uv add -e ./local-package
```

### Pattern 5: Removing Dependencies

```bash
# Remove package
uv remove requests

# Remove dev dependency
uv remove --dev pytest

# Remove multiple packages
uv remove numpy pandas matplotlib
```

### Pattern 6: Upgrading Dependencies

```bash
# Upgrade specific package
uv add --upgrade requests

# Upgrade all packages
uv sync --upgrade

# Upgrade package to latest
uv add --upgrade requests

# Show what would be upgraded
uv tree --outdated
```

### Pattern 7: Locking Dependencies

```bash
# Generate uv.lock file
uv lock

# Update lock file
uv lock --upgrade

# Lock without installing
uv lock --no-install

# Lock specific package
uv lock --upgrade-package requests
```

## Python Version Management

### Pattern 8: Installing Python Versions

```bash
# Install Python version
uv python install 3.12

# Install multiple versions
uv python install 3.11 3.12 3.13

# Install latest version
uv python install

# List installed versions
uv python list

# Find available versions
uv python list --all-versions
```

### Pattern 9: Setting Python Version

```bash
# Set Python version for project
uv python pin 3.12

# This creates/updates .python-version file

# Use specific Python version for command
uv --python 3.11 run python script.py

# Create venv with specific version
uv venv --python 3.12
```

## Project Configuration

### Pattern 10: pyproject.toml with uv

```toml
[project]
name = "my-project"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "My awesome project"
readme = "README.md"
requires-python = ">=3.8"
dependencies = [
    "requests>=2.31.0",
    "pydantic>=2.0.0",
    "click>=8.1.0",
]

[project.optional-dependencies]
dev = [
    "pytest>=7.4.0",
    "pytest-cov>=4.1.0",
    "black>=23.0.0",
    "ruff>=0.1.0",
    "mypy>=1.5.0",
]
docs = [
    "sphinx>=7.0.0",
    "sphinx-rtd-theme>=1.3.0",
]

[build-system]
requires = ["hatchling"]
build-backend = "hatchling.build"

[tool.uv]
dev-dependencies = [
    # Additional dev dependencies managed by uv
]

[tool.uv.sources]
# Custom package sources
my-package = { git = "https://github.com/user/repo.git" }
```

### Pattern 11: Using uv with Existing Projects

```bash
# Migrate from requirements.txt
uv add -r requirements.txt

# Migrate from poetry
# Already have pyproject.toml, just use:
uv sync

# Export to requirements.txt
uv pip freeze > requirements.txt

# Export with hashes
uv pip freeze --require-hashes > requirements.txt
```

## Advanced Workflows

### Pattern 12: Monorepo Support

```bash
# Project structure
# monorepo/
#   packages/
#     package-a/
#       pyproject.toml
#     package-b/
#       pyproject.toml
#   pyproject.toml (root)

# Root pyproject.toml
[tool.uv.workspace]
members = ["packages/*"]

# Install all workspace packages
uv sync

# Add workspace dependency
uv add --path ./packages/package-a
```

### Pattern 13: CI/CD Integration

```yaml
# .github/workflows/test.yml
name: Tests

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Install uv
        uses: astral-sh/setup-uv@v2
        with:
          enable-cache: true

      - name: Set up Python
        run: uv python install 3.12

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: uv sync --all-extras --dev

      - name: Run tests
        run: uv run pytest

      - name: Run linting
        run: |
          uv run ruff check .
          uv run black --check .
```

### Pattern 14: Docker Integration

```dockerfile
# Dockerfile
FROM python:3.12-slim

# Install uv
COPY --from=ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:latest /uv /usr/local/bin/uv

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy dependency files
COPY pyproject.toml uv.lock ./

# Install dependencies
RUN uv sync --frozen --no-dev

# Copy application code
COPY . .

# Run application
CMD ["uv", "run", "python", "app.py"]
```

**Optimized multi-stage build:**

```dockerfile
# Multi-stage Dockerfile
FROM python:3.12-slim AS builder

# Install uv
COPY --from=ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:latest /uv /usr/local/bin/uv

WORKDIR /app

# Install dependencies to venv
COPY pyproject.toml uv.lock ./
RUN uv sync --frozen --no-dev --no-editable

# Runtime stage
FROM python:3.12-slim

WORKDIR /app

# Copy venv from builder
COPY --from=builder /app/.venv .venv
COPY . .

# Use venv
ENV PATH="/app/.venv/bin:$PATH"

CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

### Pattern 15: Lockfile Workflows

```bash
# Create lockfile (uv.lock)
uv lock

# Install from lockfile (exact versions)
uv sync --frozen

# Update lockfile without installing
uv lock --no-install

# Upgrade specific package in lock
uv lock --upgrade-package requests

# Check if lockfile is up to date
uv lock --check

# Export lockfile to requirements.txt
uv export --format requirements-txt > requirements.txt

# Export with hashes for security
uv export --format requirements-txt --hash > requirements.txt
```

## Performance Optimization

### Pattern 16: Using Global Cache

```bash
# UV automatically uses global cache at:
# Linux: ~/.cache/uv
# macOS: ~/Library/Caches/uv
# Windows: %LOCALAPPDATA%\uv\cache

# Clear cache
uv cache clean

# Check cache size
uv cache dir
```

### Pattern 17: Parallel Installation

```bash
# UV installs packages in parallel by default

# Control parallelism
uv pip install --jobs 4 package1 package2

# No parallel (sequential)
uv pip install --jobs 1 package
```

### Pattern 18: Offline Mode

```bash
# Install from cache only (no network)
uv pip install --offline package

# Sync from lockfile offline
uv sync --frozen --offline
```

## Comparison with Other Tools

### uv vs pip

```bash
# pip
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install requests pandas numpy
# ~30 seconds

# uv
uv venv
uv add requests pandas numpy
# ~2 seconds (10-15x faster)
```

### uv vs poetry

```bash
# poetry
poetry init
poetry add requests pandas
poetry install
# ~20 seconds

# uv
uv init
uv add requests pandas
uv sync
# ~3 seconds (6-7x faster)
```

### uv vs pip-tools

```bash
# pip-tools
pip-compile requirements.in
pip-sync requirements.txt
# ~15 seconds

# uv
uv lock
uv sync --frozen
# ~2 seconds (7-8x faster)
```

## Common Workflows

### Pattern 19: Starting a New Project

```bash
# Complete workflow
uv init my-project
cd my-project

# Set Python version
uv python pin 3.12

# Add dependencies
uv add fastapi uvicorn pydantic

# Add dev dependencies
uv add --dev pytest black ruff mypy

# Create structure
mkdir -p src/my_project tests

# Run tests
uv run pytest

# Format code
uv run black .
uv run ruff check .
```

### Pattern 20: Maintaining Existing Project

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/user/project.git
cd project

# Install dependencies (creates venv automatically)
uv sync

# Install with dev dependencies
uv sync --all-extras

# Update dependencies
uv lock --upgrade

# Run application
uv run python app.py

# Run tests
uv run pytest

# Add new dependency
uv add new-package

# Commit updated files
git add pyproject.toml uv.lock
git commit -m "Add new-package dependency"
```

## Tool Integration

### Pattern 21: Pre-commit Hooks

```yaml
# .pre-commit-config.yaml
repos:
  - repo: local
    hooks:
      - id: uv-lock
        name: uv lock
        entry: uv lock
        language: system
        pass_filenames: false

      - id: ruff
        name: ruff
        entry: uv run ruff check --fix
        language: system
        types: [python]

      - id: black
        name: black
        entry: uv run black
        language: system
        types: [python]
```

### Pattern 22: VS Code Integration

```json
// .vscode/settings.json
{
  "python.defaultInterpreterPath": "${workspaceFolder}/.venv/bin/python",
  "python.terminal.activateEnvironment": true,
  "python.testing.pytestEnabled": true,
  "python.testing.pytestArgs": ["-v"],
  "python.linting.enabled": true,
  "python.formatting.provider": "black",
  "[python]": {
    "editor.defaultFormatter": "ms-python.black-formatter",
    "editor.formatOnSave": true
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

```bash
# Issue: uv not found
# Solution: Add to PATH or reinstall
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc

# Issue: Wrong Python version
# Solution: Pin version explicitly
uv python pin 3.12
uv venv --python 3.12

# Issue: Dependency conflict
# Solution: Check resolution
uv lock --verbose

# Issue: Cache issues
# Solution: Clear cache
uv cache clean

# Issue: Lockfile out of sync
# Solution: Regenerate
uv lock --upgrade
```

## Best Practices

### Project Setup

1. **Always use lockfiles** for reproducibility
2. **Pin Python version** with .python-version
3. **Separate dev dependencies** from production
4. **Use uv run** instead of activating venv
5. **Commit uv.lock** to version control
6. **Use --frozen in CI** for consistent builds
7. **Leverage global cache** for speed
8. **Use workspace** for monorepos
9. **Export requirements.txt** for compatibility
10. **Keep uv updated** for latest features

### Performance Tips

```bash
# Use frozen installs in CI
uv sync --frozen

# Use offline mode when possible
uv sync --offline

# Parallel operations (automatic)
# uv does this by default

# Reuse cache across environments
# uv shares cache globally

# Use lockfiles to skip resolution
uv sync --frozen  # skips resolution
```

## Migration Guide

### From pip + requirements.txt

```bash
# Before
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# After
uv venv
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
# Or better:
uv init
uv add -r requirements.txt
```

### From Poetry

```bash
# Before
poetry install
poetry add requests

# After
uv sync
uv add requests

# Keep existing pyproject.toml
# uv reads [project] and [tool.poetry] sections
```

### From pip-tools

```bash
# Before
pip-compile requirements.in
pip-sync requirements.txt

# After
uv lock
uv sync --frozen
```

## Command Reference
