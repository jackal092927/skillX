[Common wrapper]
You are revising a Task skill, not directly solving the task.
Use the provided Meta schema as class-level guidance.
Your goal is to improve the Task skill for this task while preserving useful existing structure.

[Meta schema block]
Category: environment-control
Semantic intent: Interact with a simulator, planner, or dynamic environment under explicit metric or validity constraints.
Emphasize:
- world / simulator / environment state understanding
- explicit control or planning loop structure
- parameter, policy, or plan validation
- metric-facing evaluation after execution
Avoid:
- overly textual synthesis behavior
- weak feedback loops between action and evaluation
- artifact-first thinking when the task is really environment-facing
Expected good fit:
- control design
- planning with validity constraints
- simulator-driven evaluation tasks
Expected bad fit:
- document formatting / artifact generation
- pure evidence synthesis tasks
Hypothesized primary failure modes:
- unavailable in prompt-bank-v0.1; use task-local evidence instead
Meta schema seed guidance:
You are revising a skill for an environment-control task.
Optimize the skill around interacting with a planner, simulator, or controlled environment under explicit validity or metric constraints.

Prioritize:
1. clear modeling of state, parameters, or action space,
2. an execution loop that includes evaluate-and-adjust behavior,
3. explicit metric / validity checks after candidate actions or plans,
4. concise recording of outputs needed by the evaluator.

If the task is failing, first strengthen control-loop structure and metric feedback before adding generic analysis scaffolding.

## mesh-analysis
---
name: mesh-analysis
description: "Analyzes 3D mesh files (STL) to calculate geometric properties (volume, components) and extract attribute data. Use this skill to process noisy 3D scan data and filter debris."
---

# Mesh Analysis

This skill provides the `MeshAnalyzer` tool for robustly processing 3D STL files. It handles Binary STL parsing and connected component analysis.

## When to Use

Use this skill for:
1.  **Geometric Analysis**: Calculating volume of complex or noisy meshes.
2.  **Noise Filtering**: Isolating the largest connected component from "dirty" scan data.
3.  **Attribute Extraction**: Extracting metadata (e.g. material IDs) stored in the STL file attribute bytes.

## Usage

The tool is provided as a Python module in the `scripts/` directory.

### Basic Workflow

```python
import sys
# Add skill path to sys.path
sys.path.append('/root/.claude/skills/mesh-analysis/scripts')

from mesh_tool import MeshAnalyzer

# Initialize with file path
analyzer = MeshAnalyzer('/path/to/your/file.stl')

# Analyze specific components
# Automatically identifies the largest component (main part)
report = analyzer.analyze_largest_component()

volume = report['main_part_volume']
mat_id = report['main_part_material_id']

print(f"Volume: {volume}")
print(f"Material ID: {mat_id}")
```

### Calculating Mass

The tool provides the **Volume** and **Material ID**. To calculate **Mass**:
1.  Read the **Material ID** from the analysis report.
2.  Consult your provided material reference data (e.g. density tables) to find the density.
3.  Calculate: `Mass = Volume * Density`.

**Critical Note on Units**:
*   The **Volume** returned is in the **same units** as the STL file's coordinates (cubed).
*   **Do not assume** millimeters or inches. Check your task instructions for the coordinate system units (e.g., if coordinates are in cm, volume is in cm³).
*   If your density table uses the same unit (e.g., g/cm³ and cm³), **multiply directly**. No unit conversion is needed.

## Critical Notes

*   **Binary Support**: The tool automatically handles Binary STL files.
*   **Attribute extraction**: The tool extracts the 2-byte attribute stored in the binary STL format (often used for color or material ID).
