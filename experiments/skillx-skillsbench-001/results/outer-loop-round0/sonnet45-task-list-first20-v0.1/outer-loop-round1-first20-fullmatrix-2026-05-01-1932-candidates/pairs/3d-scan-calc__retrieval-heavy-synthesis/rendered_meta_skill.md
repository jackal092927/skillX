You are revising a Task skill, not directly solving the task.
Use the provided Meta schema as class-level guidance.
Your goal is to improve the Task skill for this task while preserving useful existing structure.

[Meta schema block]
Category: retrieval-heavy-synthesis
Semantic intent: Gather evidence from sources, compress it correctly, and synthesize an output without dropping support.
Emphasize:
- retrieval plan that explicitly identifies external sources and access paths before processing
- evidence tracking with explicit provenance chains linking each claim to its supporting external source
- compression that preserves source citations and provenance chains alongside synthesized output
- abstain / unknown behavior when evidence is insufficient
- external source grounding discipline - explicitly identify and track which external source (file, API, database, document) supports each claim
- explicit provenance chains - maintain traceable mappings from output claims back to specific input evidence locations
- multi-source reconciliation - handle conflicting or partial evidence across multiple external sources with explicit conflict resolution
Avoid:
- unsupported synthesis
- hallucinated joins across sources
- excessive workflow scaffolding that obscures evidence use
- treating staged data processing as retrieval-synthesis when the task does not require external source provenance tracking
Expected good fit:
- information search
- handbook / database grounded QA
- report or answer generation from external sources
- tasks requiring multi-source evidence reconciliation with explicit provenance tracking
Expected bad fit:
- simulator/control tasks
- code patch workflows
- staged multi-step data processing pipelines without explicit external source grounding requirements
- tasks where the primary challenge is workflow orchestration rather than evidence provenance discipline
Hypothesized primary failure modes:
- unavailable in prompt-bank-v0.1; use task-local evidence instead
Meta schema seed guidance:
You are revising a skill for a retrieval-heavy-synthesis task.
Schema intent: Gather evidence from sources, compress it correctly, and synthesize an output without dropping support.

Outer-loop update mode: differentiating. Keep the Render layer fixed and change only schema-level guidance.

Prioritize:
1. retrieval plan that explicitly identifies external sources and access paths before processing
2. evidence tracking with explicit provenance chains linking each claim to its supporting external source
3. compression that preserves source citations and provenance chains alongside synthesized output
4. abstain / unknown behavior when evidence is insufficient
5. external source grounding discipline - explicitly identify and track which external source (file, API, database, document) supports each claim
6. explicit provenance chains - maintain traceable mappings from output claims back to specific input evidence locations
7. multi-source reconciliation - handle conflicting or partial evidence across multiple external sources with explicit conflict resolution

Avoid:
1. unsupported synthesis
2. hallucinated joins across sources
3. excessive workflow scaffolding that obscures evidence use
4. treating staged data processing as retrieval-synthesis when the task does not require external source provenance tracking

Good fit when:
- information search
- handbook / database grounded QA
- report or answer generation from external sources
- tasks requiring multi-source evidence reconciliation with explicit provenance tracking

Bad fit when:
- simulator/control tasks
- code patch workflows
- staged multi-step data processing pipelines without explicit external source grounding requirements
- tasks where the primary challenge is workflow orchestration rather than evidence provenance discipline

Primary failure modes to guard against:
- boundary ambiguity with analytic-pipeline on tasks that process data but don't require external source provenance tracking
- schema assignment to pipeline-pattern tasks that lack load-bearing evidence grounding requirements

Regenerate task-specific skill guidance from these slots; do not invent a new policy outside them.

## mesh-analysis

name: mesh-analysis
description: "Analyzes 3D mesh files (STL) to calculate geometric properties (volume, components) and extract attribute data. Use this skill to process noisy 3D scan data and filter debris."
---

# Mesh Analysis

This skill provides the `MeshAnalyzer` tool for robustly processing 3D STL files. It handles Binary STL parsing and connected component analysis.

## When to Use

Use this skill for:
1.  **Geometric Analysis**: Calculating volume of complex or noisy meshes.
2.  **Noise Filtering**: Isolating the largest connected component from "dirty" scan data.
3.  **Attribute Extraction**: Extracting metadata (e.g. material IDs) stored in the STL file attribute bytes.

## Usage

The tool is provided as a Python module in the `scripts/` directory.

### Basic Workflow

```python
import sys
# Add skill path to sys.path
sys.path.append('/root/.claude/skills/mesh-analysis/scripts')

from mesh_tool import MeshAnalyzer

# Initialize with file path
analyzer = MeshAnalyzer('/path/to/your/file.stl')

# Analyze specific components
# Automatically identifies the largest component (main part)
report = analyzer.analyze_largest_component()

volume = report['main_part_volume']
mat_id = report['main_part_material_id']

print(f"Volume: {volume}")
print(f"Material ID: {mat_id}")
```

### Calculating Mass

The tool provides the **Volume** and **Material ID**. To calculate **Mass**:
1.  Read the **Material ID** from the analysis report.
2.  Consult your provided material reference data (e.g. density tables) to find the density.
3.  Calculate: `Mass = Volume * Density`.

**Critical Note on Units**:
*   The **Volume** returned is in the **same units** as the STL file's coordinates (cubed).
*   **Do not assume** millimeters or inches. Check your task instructions for the coordinate system units (e.g., if coordinates are in cm, volume is in cm³).
*   If your density table uses the same unit (e.g., g/cm³ and cm³), **multiply directly**. No unit conversion is needed.

## Critical Notes

*   **Binary Support**: The tool automatically handles Binary STL files.
*   **Attribute extraction**: The tool extracts the 2-byte attribute stored in the binary STL format (often used for color or material ID).
