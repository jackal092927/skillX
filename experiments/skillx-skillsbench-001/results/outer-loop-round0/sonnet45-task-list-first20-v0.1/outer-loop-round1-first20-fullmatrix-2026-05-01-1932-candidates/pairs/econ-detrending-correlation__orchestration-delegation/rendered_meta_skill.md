Category: orchestration-delegation
Semantic intent: Coordinate ordered external actions or substeps where sequence and dependency management matter.
Emphasize:
- constraint extraction before action
- ordering across dependent steps / systems
- state handoff between stages or tools
- fail-safe finalization and side-effect awareness
- extract coordination-specific failure modes (state conflicts, ordering violations, side-effect races) before adding general procedural scaffolding
- make multi-system or multi-stage handoff protocols explicit when one component's output constrains another's input
- name which execution stage outputs become binding constraints or prerequisites for downstream stages
Avoid:
- eager direct completion without dependency checks
- reviewer-only prompts that lack execution choreography
- over-abstract synthesis that ignores operational order
Expected good fit:
- scheduling / delegation workflows
- multi-system action coordination
- tasks where one substep creates constraints for the next
- tasks where execution order matters due to external side effects, system state changes, or cross-tool dependencies
Expected bad fit:
- static artifact-only tasks
- deep scientific analysis pipelines
- tasks primarily focused on data transformation pipelines without external coordination requirements
Hypothesized primary failure modes:
- unavailable in prompt-bank-v0.1; use task-local evidence instead

Outer-loop update mode: differentiating. Keep the Render layer fixed and change only schema-level guidance.

3. over-abstract synthesis that ignores operational order

Good fit when:
- scheduling / delegation workflows
- multi-system action coordination
- tasks where one substep creates constraints for the next

Bad fit when:
- static artifact-only tasks
- deep scientific analysis pipelines
- tasks primarily focused on data transformation pipelines without external coordination requirements

Primary failure modes to guard against:
- boundary confusion with analytic-pipeline on tasks that have both coordination aspects and analysis workflows, where the schema fails to articulate why orchestration concerns dominate

Regenerate task-specific skill guidance from these slots; do not invent a new policy outside them.

Task name: econ-detrending-correlation
Task summary: In macroeconomics, understanding business cycle dynamics requires separating the trend component (long-term growth) from the cyclical component (short-term fluctuations) of economic time series. This task involves applying standard detrending techniques to analyze how consumption and investment move together over the business cycle. Goal: Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between the detrended real personal consumption expenditures (PCE) and the detrended real private fixed investment (PFI) for the years 1973 to 2024 (inclusive).

# Time Series Detrending for Macroeconomic Analysis

This skill provides guidance on decomposing economic time series into trend and cyclical components, a fundamental technique in business cycle analysis.

## Overview

Economic time series like GDP, consumption, and investment contain both long-term trends and short-term fluctuations (business cycles). Separating these components is essential for:
- Analyzing business cycle correlations
- Comparing volatility across variables
- Identifying leading/lagging indicators

## The Hodrick-Prescott (HP) Filter

The HP filter is the most widely used method for detrending macroeconomic data. It decomposes a time series into a trend component and a cyclical component.

### Mathematical Foundation

Given a time series $y_t$, the HP filter finds the trend $\tau_t$ that minimizes:

$$\sum_{t=1}^{T}(y_t - \tau_t)^2 + \lambda \sum_{t=2}^{T-1}[(\tau_{t+1} - \tau_t) - (\tau_t - \tau_{t-1})]^2$$

Where:
- First term: Minimizes deviation of data from trend
- Second term: Penalizes changes in the trend's growth rate
- $\lambda$: Smoothing parameter controlling the trade-off

### Choosing Lambda (λ)

**Critical**: The choice of λ depends on data frequency:

| Data Frequency | Recommended λ | Rationale |
|----------------|---------------|-----------|
| Annual         | **100**       | Standard for yearly data |
| Quarterly      | **1600**      | Hodrick-Prescott (1997) recommendation |
| Monthly        | **14400**     | Ravn-Uhlig (2002) adjustment |

**Common mistake**: Using λ=1600 (quarterly default) for annual data produces an overly smooth trend that misses important cyclical dynamics.

### Python Implementation

```python
from statsmodels.tsa.filters.hp_filter import hpfilter
import numpy as np

# Apply HP filter
# Returns: (cyclical_component, trend_component)
cycle, trend = hpfilter(data, lamb=100)  # For annual data

# For quarterly data
cycle_q, trend_q = hpfilter(quarterly_data, lamb=1600)
```

**Important**: The function parameter is `lamb` (not `lambda`, which is a Python keyword).

## Log Transformation for Growth Series

### Why Use Logs?

For most macroeconomic aggregates (GDP, consumption, investment), you should apply the natural logarithm **before** filtering:

1. **Multiplicative to Additive**: Converts percentage changes to log differences
2. **Stabilizes Variance**: Growth rates become comparable across time
3. **Economic Interpretation**: Cyclical component represents percentage deviations from trend
4. **Standard Practice**: Required for business cycle statistics that compare volatilities

```python
import numpy as np

# Apply log transformation BEFORE HP filtering
log_series = np.log(real_series)
cycle, trend = hpfilter(log_series, lamb=100)

# The cycle now represents percentage deviations from trend
# e.g., cycle = 0.02 means 2% above trend
```

### When NOT to Use Logs

- Series that can be negative (net exports, current account)
- Series already expressed as rates or percentages
- Series with zeros

## Complete Workflow for Detrending

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Load and clean data**: Handle missing values, ensure proper time ordering
2. **Convert to real terms**: Deflate nominal values using appropriate price index
3. **Apply log transformation**: For positive level variables
4. **Apply HP filter**: Use appropriate λ for data frequency
5. **Analyze cyclical component**: Compute correlations, volatilities, etc.

### Example: Business Cycle Correlation

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from statsmodels.tsa.filters.hp_filter import hpfilter

# Load real (inflation-adjusted) data
real_consumption = pd.Series(...)  # Real consumption expenditure
real_investment = pd.Series(...)   # Real fixed investment

# Log transformation
ln_consumption = np.log(real_consumption)
ln_investment = np.log(real_investment)

# HP filter with λ=100 for annual data
cycle_c, trend_c = hpfilter(ln_consumption, lamb=100)
cycle_i, trend_i = hpfilter(ln_investment, lamb=100)

# Compute correlation of cyclical components
correlation = np.corrcoef(cycle_c, cycle_i)[0, 1]
print(f"Business cycle correlation: {correlation:.4f}")
```
